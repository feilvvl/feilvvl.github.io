## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student since 2024, advised by [Prof. Changjian Chen](https://changjianchen.github.io/), at the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China. Before that, I received my B.S. in Software Engineering from [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn). My research interest focuses on visualizations, especially visual analysis methods to improve training data quality.
